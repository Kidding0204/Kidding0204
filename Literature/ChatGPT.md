# Constructing Dynamically:

The example constructs `(car '(a b c))` dynamically using `list`:

``` scheme
(list 'car (list 'quote '(a b c))) 
```

1. `(list 'quote '(a b c))`:

- `'quote` is treated as the symbol `quote`.
- `'(a b c)` evaluates to the list `(a b c)`.
- So, `(list 'quote '(a b c))` produces: `(quote (a b c))`.
2. `(list 'car ...)`:

- `'car` is treated as the symbol `car`.
- `(list 'quote '(a b c))` gives `(quote (a b c))`.
- So, `(list 'car (list 'quote '(a b c)))` produces: `(car (quote (a b c)))`.

This is equivalent to the earlier expression `(car '(a b c))`.

# Destroyed Substitution of Equal

- **Example**:
```scheme
(define x 'three)
(define y (+ 1 2))
```
Even if `x` and `y` might both represent `3` in some contexts, they are fundamentally different:
- `x` is the symbol `'three`, while `y` evaluates to the number `3`.
- Substituting `x` for `y` would lead to errors or unexpected behavior in contexts requiring numerical values.
