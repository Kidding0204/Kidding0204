# Derivative

> > It is the **[[Limit]](boundary value)** of the [[rate of change]] when ==the $\Delta x$ approaches 0==, but ==$\Delta x$ can never be 0==.

> > [!note]- constant
> > During ==the process of acquiring the [[Limit]]==, we make $\Delta x$ be 0 which cancels out the terms consist of unspecified variable $\Delta x$.
